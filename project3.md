Verilog 6x64 Decoder
===============

-   **Class:** Computer Architecture CSCI 330
-   **Grade:** lab13 A/100
-   **Language(s):** Verilog
-   **Source Code Repository:** [features/mastering-markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Project description

The 6x64 decoder is exactly what it sounds like. It takes 6 input wires of 1's and 0's and outputs the binary to a corresponding output wire. For example, the binary 001001 would output a signal through the 9th wire.

## How to compile and run the program

You can compile and run the project with the command:
```
make
```
Success will have a screen with rows of mostly 63 0's and a single 1 with the exception of the input of six 0's (see Fig. 1)
